# ðŸ“Š Pokebot Development Progress

## Phase 0: Foundations âœ… COMPLETE
**Duration**: 1 session  
**Status**: âœ… Done

### What We Built
- Git repository initialized
- Monorepo structure with workspaces
- TypeScript configuration (root + scout service)
- GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline
- Basic scout service with file-based SKU monitoring
- Environment configuration template
- Comprehensive README with roadmap

### Files Created
```
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json              # Root monorepo config
â”œâ”€â”€ tsconfig.json            # TypeScript config
â”œâ”€â”€ .gitignore               # Git ignore rules
â”œâ”€â”€ .env.example             # Environment template
â”œâ”€â”€ skus.json                # SKU monitoring file
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md                # Project documentation
â”œâ”€â”€ .github/workflows/ci.yml # CI/CD pipeline
â””â”€â”€ services/scout/
    â”œâ”€â”€ package.json         # Scout service config
    â”œâ”€â”€ tsconfig.json        # Scout TypeScript config
    â””â”€â”€ src/index.ts         # Main scout logic
```

### Key Features Implemented
- **File Watcher**: Auto-reloads when `skus.json` changes
- **Multi-Site Support**: Walmart & Best Buy stock checking
- **Jittered Polling**: 30s intervals with random delays
- **Basic Stock Detection**: HTML scraping for out-of-stock indicators
- **Graceful Shutdown**: Proper cleanup on SIGINT

### Technical Decisions
- **Language**: TypeScript/Node.js (leveraging existing JS skills)
- **Architecture**: Modular services in monorepo
- **Stock Detection**: Simple HTML scraping (will enhance in Phase 1)
- **Configuration**: File-based SKUs for easy updates
- **No Dependencies**: Kept minimal - axios, chokidar, dotenv

## Next: Phase 1 - Enhanced Scout
**Target**: 2 weeks  
**Focus**: Better stock detection, proxy support, anti-detection

### Planned Improvements
- [ ] JSON API endpoints for faster stock checks
- [ ] Proxy rotation system
- [ ] Better error handling and retry logic
- [ ] Rate limiting and anti-detection measures
- [ ] More sophisticated stock detection algorithms

**Current Status**: Phase 0 Complete, Ready for Phase 1

Next Steps:
Investigate Walmart Stock API. According to GPT it says there is a inventory api the walmart
website hits. it was discovered by some reverse-engineered devs but im skepikal on how much
permission we will have on there. once we have walmart at a place where we like, we need to 
make sure its code can be deployed as agents, so it can be monitored in multiple places if need 
be. after that we will begin target. since we are in a discord that checks its stock, we will 
have immediate feedback if our application works or does not work.
